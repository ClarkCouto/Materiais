As implied by the name, the Roles parameter can take more than one role. You can pass in a comma-delimited list:
[Authorize(Roles="Administrator,SuperAdmin")] public class TopSecretController:Controller

You can also authorize by a list of users:
[Authorize(Users="Jon,Phil,Scott,Brad,David")] public class TopSecretController:Controller

And you can combine them, as well:
[Authorize(Roles="UsersNamedScott", Users="Jon,Phil,Brad,David")] public class TopSecretController:Controller
